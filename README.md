# Configurable #

A Rails 3 configuration plugin. An update to [Behavior](http://github.com/paulca/behavior).

## How it works ##

Configurable lets you define app-wide configuration variables and values in `config/configurable.yml`. These can then be accessed throughout your app.

If you or your app users need to change these variables, Configurable stores new values in the database.

## Installation ##

Configurable is available as a Ruby gem. Simply add it to your Rails 3 app's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'configurable'
